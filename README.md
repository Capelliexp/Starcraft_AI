# Scripted Starcraft AI
Scripted Starcraft AI, simple behavior with structured build-path and tactics.

Downloading and installing the original Starcraft, followed by running git-repo/Starcraft/MyBot/MyBot.sln initializes a 1v1 PvP match between the AI and a built-in Starcraft bot.

My code can be found in git-repo/Starcraft/MyBot/MyBot/Source/
